### 1. (0.5 points)Let us suppose the following bits sequence: 1011000001. Draw the resulting waveform after applying the subsequent encoding techniques:
### NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, Differential Manchester, Bipolar AMI

|    Encoding \ Bits    | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

### 2. (0.5 points) Describe the main optical fiber types.

 * Multi-mode: multiple directions, losses, cheaper
   * Step-index: core has constant refraction
   * Graded-index: the core refraction is a gradient that curves light
 * Single-mode: straight line, tiny core, hight speed, expensive

### 3. (0.75 points) Provided that there is a 10 MHz bandwidth channel, we transmit a 32-QAM signal.
#### (a) Calculate the bit rate, supposing that the is no noise in the channel.
#### (b) If SNR=20dB, calculate the maximum channel transmission speed.
#### (c) What is the maximum number of signal elements that could be used? What is the maximum bit rate?




### 4. (0.5 points) Provided that there is a UTP-5 cable, that the attenuation is -220 dB/km for a 100 MHz frequency, that we transmit with 2W power and we need to receive 2 mW at least, calculate the maximum cable length.




### 5. (0.5 points) Determine which type of MAC addresses are the following ones:
#### (a) 33:33:ff:d3:f0:42
Multicast, local
#### (b) 02:00:00:00:01:01
Unicastm local
#### (c) ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
Broadcast
#### (d) 10:0b:a9:bc:50:21
Unicast, global





### 6. (0.5 points) We want to interconnect two Ethernet 100BaseTX hubs. Considering that to every hub the stations can be connected through cables whose maximum length is 50m, that the maximum hubs separation is 100m, and that the network introduces the delays hereafter described, determine what is the maximum Fast Ethernet hub delay to implement a feasible network.
 * 100BASE-TX network card delay: 0:3µs
 * Cable propagation delay: 0:55µs per every 100m.



### 7. (0.5 points) In a wireless network, what is the hidden station problem? Which mechanism is utilized in the 802.11 standard to avoid it?

Two stations that don't see each other may use the same channel to communicate with a central station.
Fix: RTS/CTS extension. Data is not send until Clear To Send is received.


### 8. (0.5 points) A tiny network is represented in the figure. Switches have just been rebooted because of a power supply problem, so their (MAC, port) tables are empty. After every event hereafter described, indicate the addresses that will be introduced in the switching tables (just after finishing the event). Moreover, indicate the links which any packet has gone through during every concrete event. Each event happens after the other and hence the switches only depend on the previous state.

#### (a) PC B sends an Ethernet frame. Source MAC = MACPCB, destination MAC = MACPCA
#### (b) PC D sends an Ethernet frame. Source MAC = MACPCD, destination MAC = MACPCB
#### (c) PC E sends an Ethernet frame. Source MAC = MACPCE, destination MAC = MACPCD
