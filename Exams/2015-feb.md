### 1. (0.5 points)Let us suppose the following bits sequence: 1011000001. Draw the resulting waveform after applying the subsequent encoding techniques:
### NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, Differential Manchester, Bipolar AMI

|    Encoding \ Bits    | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
|     -------------     |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|         NRZ-L         |___|¯¯¯|___|___|¯¯¯|¯¯¯|¯¯¯|¯¯¯|¯¯¯|___|

### 2. (0.5 points) Describe the main optical fiber types.

 * Multi-mode: multiple directions, losses, cheaper
   * Step-index: core has constant refraction
   * Graded-index: the core refraction is a gradient that curves light
 * Single-mode: straight line, tiny core, hight speed, expensive

### 3. (0.75 points) Provided that there is a 10 MHz bandwidth channel, we transmit a 32-QAM signal.
#### (a) Calculate the bit rate, supposing that the is no noise in the channel.
#### (b) If SNR=20dB, calculate the maximum channel transmission speed.
#### (c) What is the maximum number of signal elements that could be used? What is the maximum bit rate?




### 4. (0.5 points) Provided that there is a UTP-5 cable, that the attenuation is -220 dB/km for a 100 MHz frequency, that we transmit with 2W power and we need to receive 2 mW at least, calculate the maximum cable length.


### 5. (0.5 points) Determine which type of MAC addresses are the following ones:
#### (a) 33:33:ff:d3:f0:42
#### (b) 02:00:00:00:01:01
#### (c) ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
#### (d) 10:0b:a9:bc:50:21
