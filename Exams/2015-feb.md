### 2. (0.5 points) Describe the main optical fiber types.

 * Multi-mode: multiple directions, losses, cheaper
   * Step-index: core has constant refraction
   * Graded-index: the core refraction is a gradient that curves light
 * Single-mode: straight line, tiny core, hight speed, expensive

### 3. (0.75 points) Provided that there is a 10 MHz bandwidth channel, we transmit a 32-QAM signal.
#### (a) Calculate the bit rate, supposing that the is no noise in the channel.
#### (b) If SNR=20dB, calculate the maximum channel transmission speed.
#### (c) What is the maximum number of signal elements that could be used? What is the maximum bit rate?




### 4. (0.5 points) Provided that there is a UTP-5 cable, that the attenuation is -220 dB/km for a 100 MHz frequency, that we transmit with 2W power and we need to receive 2 mW at least, calculate the maximum cable length.




### 5. (0.5 points) Determine which type of MAC addresses are the following ones:
#### (a) 33:33:ff:d3:f0:42
Multicast, local
#### (b) 02:00:00:00:01:01
Unicast local
#### (c) ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
Broadcast
#### (d) 10:0b:a9:bc:50:21
Unicast, global





### 6. (0.5 points) We want to interconnect two Ethernet 100BaseTX hubs. Considering that to every hub the stations can be connected through cables whose maximum length is 50m, that the maximum hubs separation is 100m, and that the network introduces the delays hereafter described, determine what is the maximum Fast Ethernet hub delay to implement a feasible network.
 * 100BASE-TX network card delay: 0:3µs
 * Cable propagation delay: 0:55µs per every 100m.



### 7. (0.5 points) In a wireless network, what is the hidden station problem? Which mechanism is utilized in the 802.11 standard to avoid it?

Two stations that don't see each other may use the same channel to communicate with a central station.
Fix: RTS/CTS extension. Data is not send until Clear To Send is received.


### 8. (0.5 points) A tiny network is represented in the figure. Switches have just been rebooted because of a power supply problem, so their (MAC, port) tables are empty. After every event hereafter described, indicate the addresses that will be introduced in the switching tables (just after finishing the event). Moreover, indicate the links which any packet has gone through during every concrete event. Each event happens after the other and hence the switches only depend on the previous state.

#### (a) PC B sends an Ethernet frame. Source MAC = MACPCB, destination MAC = MACPCA
#### (b) PC D sends an Ethernet frame. Source MAC = MACPCD, destination MAC = MACPCB
#### (c) PC E sends an Ethernet frame. Source MAC = MACPCE, destination MAC = MACPCD

### 9. (0.5 points) If the routing tables are corrupted, an IP datagram could enter in a loop. Briefly explain the mechanism employed by IP to avoid the datagram indefinitely travelling through the network.



### 10. (0.75 points) Let us suppose a network with the 85.16.225.0/24 address. Utilizing VLSM, the following subnetworks will be created:

 * 1 subnetwork containing 100 hosts
 * 4 subnetworks containing 20 hosts each one.
### Determine a possible subnetwork division in order to comply with the aforementioned constraints. Specify the subnetwork address and the mask for every case, using dot-decimal notation.





### 11. (0.75 points) A Regional Internet Registry entity possesses available addresses ranging from 41.74.112.0 to 41.74.207.255. This entity wants to delegate two consecutive 8000 address-blocks to a couple of Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Specify the network address, mask, broadcast address as well as the addresses range bound to every ISP.





### 12. (0.75 points) Considering the following figure, computer A tries to establish a TCP connection with computer B. The server TCP port is 8000, while the ephemeral port assigned to the client is 35674. Provided that initially all the ARP tables are empty, and that both computers use the router in the figure as the default one, list all the ARP messages and TCP segments that go through the 192.168.1.0 network until the connection is finally established, indicating:

 * (a) For the ARP messages: type of ARP packet (OpCode); hw_src, ip_src, hw_target and ip_target addresses contained within the ARP message; source and destination MAC addresses belonging to the Ethernet frame header.
 * (b) For the TCP segments: source and destination ports; TCP flags belonging to the TCP header; source and destination addresses belonging to the IP packet header; source and destination MAC addresses belonging to the Ethernet frame header.

### 13. (0.5 points) Draw a scheme showing the TCP segments which are interchanged between the client and the server in the following scenarios:

 * (a) Connection establishment supposing that the TCP server port is closed.
 * (b) End of the connection in a 4-wary TCP protocol.


 
 
 
### 14. (0.5 points) Explain the differences between the UDP and TCP transport layer protocols.
 
 
 
### 15. (0.5 points) Provided that there is a TCP connection. The source (A) sends several 1024-byte data segments, which get to the destination (B) in the order depicted by the figure. Complete this figure with the acknowledge numbers (ACK) belonging to the segments returned by B.
