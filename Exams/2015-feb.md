### 1. (0.5 points)Let us suppose the following bits sequence: 1011000001. Draw the resulting waveform after applying the subsequent encoding techniques:
### NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, Differential Manchester, Bipolar AMI

|    Encoding \ Bits    | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

### 2. (0.5 points) Describe the main optical fiber types.

 * Multi-mode: multiple directions, losses, cheaper
   * Step-index: core has constant refraction
   * Graded-index: the core refraction is a gradient that curves light
 * Single-mode: straight line, tiny core, hight speed, expensive
